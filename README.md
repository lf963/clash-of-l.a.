# Clash of L.A.
Clash of L.A. is a 2D tower defense game. However, it is different from most of the traditional tower defense games. In most of the traditional tower defense games, spawned enemies comes from one place and go to the only castle in the map and attack it. There is only one castle and player has to defend it. In contrast, in Clash of L.A. there are two castles, which are called Nexus in our game. Both of the Nexus spawn enemies, which are called athletes, and these athletes go toward the opposite Nexus and attack it.

We developed this game on IOS by Unity. I only upload the source code onto GitHub because most of the asset and prefab in Unity are not code.
